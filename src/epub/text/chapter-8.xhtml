				<h2 epub:type="title">The Sage of Monticello: The First Inaugural Address of Thomas Jefferson</h2>
				<h3><i>by</i> Peter S. Onuf</h3>
			</hgroup>
			<p>Few of those who gathered in Washington, <abbr class="postal">DC</abbr>, the new capital city, on March 4, 1801 to hear Thomas Jefferson deliver his first inaugural address could make out what this notoriously poor public speaker had to say. But the Virginian’s eloquent prose soon appeared in cool print, reassuring anxious Americans across the country that the “more perfect union” the framers of the federal Constitution had so recently constructed would survive its first great crisis. Jefferson was famous for drafting the Declaration of Independence, inspiring revolutionary patriots at war to risk everything to vindicate the new nation’s claims against the former mother country. Now, as Americans retreated from the brink of anarchy and disunion, he counseled his countrymen to seek “that harmony and affection without which liberty, and even life itself, are but dreary things.”</p>
			<p>Over the preceding decade, deepening partisan divisions between the Federalist administrations of presidents George Washington and John Adams and Jeffersonian Republican insurgents threatened to destroy the union, unleash the “dogs of war,” and reverse the Revolution’s outcome. The Constitution’s failure to distinguish between Electoral College votes for president and vice president in the 1800 presidential election exacerbated the crisis, producing an unexpected tie in the final count between Jefferson and Aaron Burr, his putative running mate, and throwing the choice into the House of Representatives where each state’s congressional delegation would have an equal vote. (The 12th Amendment to the Constitution, adopted before the next presidential canvass in 1804, rectified the error, distinguishing electors’ votes for president and vice president.) The 1801 impasse, finally resolved after 36 tallies from February 11 to 17, led to frantic negotiations as rumors spread that Jefferson’s angry supporters might resort to arms if their will was thwarted in a “stolen” election. When Burr’s supporters capitulated and Jefferson’s inauguration was finally assured, the new president seized the opportunity to preach peace. Promising to restore the Constitution that the American people had originally ratified, he reassured his misguided partisan opponents that they would not be persecuted. In the heat of political combat, partisans exaggerated differences, failing to recognize that “every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.” After all, Jefferson famously intoned, “We are all republicans: we are all federalists,” sharing a principled commitment to the “republican form” of government and the federal union of states. This was a message many Federalists were eager to hear. John Adams certainly had no interest in perpetuating the crisis. Though conspicuously missing from Jefferson’s inaugural audience, the former president signaled acquiescence in his former friend’s ascension by returning to his Massachusetts home to lick his wounds.</p>
			<p>In his inaugural address, Jefferson predicted a glorious future of “peace and prosperity” for the new nation. But his prophecy would only be fulfilled if his fellow Americans reaffirmed their “attachment to union and representative government.” The increasingly vicious partisan struggles of the 1790s suggested that their bold experiment in republican self-government might all too easily fail, as “the throes and convulsions of the ancient world” resulting from the French Revolutionary wars threatened to wreak havoc even on “this distant and peaceful shore.” Americans must return to Revolutionary first principles, Jefferson insisted, so recognizing the fundamental difference between their peaceful new world and an old world at war, where “infuriated man” sought “his long lost liberty⁠ ⁠… through blood and slaughter.”</p>
			<p>Jefferson was the first great exponent of American exceptionalism, situating the new nation on the cusp of the future, as “the world’s best hope,” and at a safe distance from Europe’s “convulsions.” Americans’ liberties were not “long lost,” the new president enjoined, but must instead be zealously preserved and defended against foreign threats. Republics had failed throughout ancient and modern history when demagogues and would-be despots exploited crises to seize power and deprive citizens of their liberties. In his inaugural address, the self-effacing new president sought to defuse anxieties by assuming a disarmingly modest pose. Declaring “a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents,” Jefferson juxtaposed “the greatness of the charge” to “the weakness of my powers.” He would not pretend to possess the authority or capacity to exercise rule over his fellow citizens, recognizing instead that the congressmen in his audience “are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation.” He was the people’s humble servant, the instrument of “your good will.” Just as he had given voice to the common sentiments of patriotic Americans in the Declaration of Independence, the outcome of the 1800 election was determined “by the voice of the nation, announced according to the rules of the constitution.” The success of his administration would be the people’s, not his, as they arranged “themselves under the will of the law,” and united “in common efforts for the common good.”</p>
			<p>Jefferson underscored his modest political persona by evoking the image of the recently deceased first president, George Washington, “our first and greatest revolutionary character, whose pre-eminent services had entitled him to the first place in his country’s love, and destined for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful history.” If Jefferson’s Address epitomized the exceptionalist narrative of national history, his apotheosis of Washington was his boldest rhetorical move. By focusing on the commander-in-chief’s critical role in winning the war for independence, Jefferson shifted attention away from the late 1790s, when Republicans began to mobilize <em>against</em> Washington as the Federalists’ leader. This was revisionist history, a willful denial of the bitter partisanship that had divided the past and future Virginian presidents. Effectively acknowledging that Washington had been the country’s “savior” (as so many other Americans called him), Jefferson played a key role in fashioning an American civil religion that transcended partisan divisions. Repentant Federalists would return to the fold as they reaffirmed the tenets of the national faith; for their part, Republicans would restore Washington to his exalted position in the national pantheon. By distinguishing himself from Washington and recognizing the primacy of his former political enemy, Jefferson reassured his countrymen that he would not seize and exercise despotic power. It was something of a miracle that Washington had not succumbed to the temptation to make himself a king, instead deferring to the superior authority of the people he had led to the promised land of independence. Jefferson would never face such temptation, for the power he exercised would depend on the sanction of a united people and their representatives. “The approbation implied by your suffrage is a great consolation to me for the past,” he told his fellow Americans, “and my future solicitude will be, to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance, to conciliate that of others by doing them all the good in my power, and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all.”</p>
			<p>According to the “creed of our political faith” that Jefferson elaborated in his Address, the people’s “good opinion” could not be taken for granted. His own, often troubled experience in elected office⁠—particularly as governor of Virginia⁠—and as Washington’s Secretary of State and Adams’s vice president showed how easily good citizens could divide over personalities or policy preferences. But Americans must always remind themselves of what made them a people in the first place by recurring to the first principles of republican government that the Revolutionary generation declared in 1776. “The essential principles of our government” included “equal and exact justice to all men,” “peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none,” and the perpetuation of the federal union, with “state governments” providing “the surest bulwarks against anti-republican tendencies” and “the General government in its whole constitutional vigor” guaranteeing “our peace at home, and safety abroad.” The civil liberties citizens enjoyed were both the foundation and product of properly limited, constitutional government, a benign circularity that would sustain republican rule across the generations and spare Americans the ruinous “convulsions” of revolution and regime change that drenched European battlefields in “rivers of blood.”</p>
			<p>Americans were a “chosen” people, blessed with freedoms unprecedented in human history: “freedom of religion; freedom of the press; and freedom of person, under the protection of the Habeas Corpus:⁠—and trial by juries impartially selected.” This “bright constellation” of principles had “guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation,” Jefferson proclaimed, and it would guarantee peace and prosperity for future generations as long as they upheld the republican faith. Americans were “enlightened by a benign religion, professed indeed and practised in various forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude and the love of man, acknowledging and adoring an overruling providence, which by all its dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here, and his greater happiness hereafter.” They had banished “that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered,” instead erecting the “wall of separation” between church and state that Jefferson codified in his Bill for Religious Freedom in Virginia (1786) and James Madison incorporated in the federal Bill of Rights (1791). A plurality of churches nourished a common faith in the constellation of principles that would make Americans a great and flourishing people. Faithful republicans looked beyond superficial differences in profession and practice to recognize the hand of God in their providential good fortune. But the partisan warfare of the 1790s raised the frightening specter of “a political intolerance, as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions.” Convinced of their own righteousness, political zealots waged a holy war against their supposed partisan enemies, exaggerating differences over policies and personalities and losing sight of the fundamental principles that inspired the patriots of 1776 and bound them to one another. Jefferson’s distinction between principle and opinion thus coincided with the line he drew between the spheres of religion and politics. The “creed of our political faith” should teach us that first things (and last) transcended the evanescent passions and prejudices of political conflict. Americans should look back on the political turbulence of the recent past and be grateful that⁠—for all the portentous rattling of sabers⁠—they had not taken the fatal plunge into disunion and anarchy and a bloody war of all against all.</p>
			<p>In his inaugural address, Jefferson⁠—a deist, if not worse, according to hostile critics⁠—deployed religious language to reassure anxious Americans that God (or “an overruling providence”) was on their side, urging them to look beyond the perilous moment. God’s presence in his Address, like Washington’s, emphasized Jefferson’s modest pretensions as he assumed the reins of power: he was the people’s humble servant, pledging fealty to the republican creed and the federal union of states. The perfection and perpetuity of that union ultimately depended on the character of the American people. “Let us then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind” to fulfill our destiny, he prayerfully intoned: “may that infinite power, which rules the destinies of the universe, lead our councils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity.” Jefferson thus envisioned a sacredly sanctioned civil millennium, a terrestrial life everlasting for a fortunate people “possessing a chosen country, with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation.”</p>
