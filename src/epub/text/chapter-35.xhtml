			<h2>Millard Fillmore</h2>
			<h3>Announcement to Congress of the Death of President Taylor</h3>
			<h4>Wednesday, July 10th, 1850</h4>
			<p>
				<i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:</i>
			</p>
			<p>I have to perform the melancholy duty of announcing to you that it has pleased Almighty God to remove from this life Zachary Taylor, late President of the United States. He deceased last evening at the hour of half-past 10 o’clock, in the midst of his family and surrounded by affectionate friends, calmly and in the full possession of all his faculties. Among his last words were these, which he uttered with emphatic distinctness:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>I have always done my duty. I am ready to die. My only regret is for the friends I leave behind me.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Having announced to you, fellow-citizens, this most afflicting bereavement, and assuring you that it has penetrated no heart with deeper grief than mine, it remains for me to say that I propose this day at 12 o’clock, in the Hall of the House of Representatives, in the presence of both Houses of Congress, to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution, to enable me to enter on the execution of the office which this event has devolved on me.</p>
